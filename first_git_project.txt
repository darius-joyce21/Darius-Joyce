    Throughtout my time in the computer science couses I could have used a source code management system a 
few times. It would have allowed me to work on parts of my projects throughout the last year without 
altering the original piece of work. This would have been useful in our most recent "teller project".
I made several mistakes throughtout the project and would delete my previous code with no roll back
and this created sereral issues for me. If I deleted one line of code and changed it then eventually 
realized orginal line was better, I would have no way of going back. This created many problems and 
resulted in the project taking excess amounts of time.

    Also, early in my computer science classes a friend and I would assist each other on bug fixes in 
each other's code. Having a distributed SCMs would have allowed each of us to help out form different 
locations. This would have saved time and eleiminated the need for constantl meet ups or study dates. 
The features I would make the best use of is creating many branches of the original project. The branches
would have the corrections or different ways of doing the code in them.
